# Subbiesnap - README

## Overview

Subbiesnap is a job board designed specifically to facilitate the connection between employers and sole traders who sell their time, rather than pricing for work. This platform allows employers to post job openings, and sole traders to browse and apply for jobs that match their skills and availability. Subbiesnap was created to address the gap left by other job boards that aren't tailored for sole traders, while also providing a cost-effective alternative to expensive agencies. The platform is user-friendly, ensuring an efficient and straightforward job search experience for all users.
